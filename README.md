# social-media-dashboard
This awesome dashboard was built by the one and only Reece Vela, and looks really awesome so you should check it out [reecevela.github.io/social-media-dashboard](https://reecevela.github.io/social-media-dashboard)

This site I built to learn more about advanced HTML and CSS. It also uses JS to dynamically insert the repeated elements, and tie trending users profile pictures to their accounts.

I honestly think this is the most beautiful site I've created thus far and am really happy with it. 

Technologies used:
- HTML5
